The program is also providing training to Red Cross staff and volunteers on disaster preparedness best practices like keeping a basic emergency kit in the home and actions that individuals should take in the event of an earthquake. Through this regional program, the American Red Cross is working with local Red Cross partners to improve disaster preparedness in Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Panama and Paraguay.
